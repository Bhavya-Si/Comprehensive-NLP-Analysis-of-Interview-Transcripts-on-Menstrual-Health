Topic: Do University Students Feel Comfortable Discussing Menstruation in Academic Spaces?

This study explores whether university students feel comfortable discussing menstruation within academic spaces, aiming to understand the social, cultural, and institutional factors that influence openness around this often-stigmatized topic.

It includes data ingestion from docx. file formats, flexible Q/A extraction, text preprocessing, sentiment analysis using VADER and TextBlob, topic modeling with LDA and NMF, semantic clustering with UMAP and HDBSCAN, and multiple visualizations such as word clouds, sentiment distributions, and topic distributions.
